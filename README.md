# jekyllblog
A new website project built in Jekyll

Welcome to my Github jekyll blog description. 
I plan on using my blog as a home for my portfolio, thoughts, and even videos at some point. 

To build project and create local server
`jekyll build`
`jekyll serve`
And prefix with `bundle exec` in order to ensure correct jekyll version is used.

Server name is by default http://localhost:4000/
