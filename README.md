# jekyllblog
A new website project built in Jekyll

Welcome to my Github jekyll blog description. 
I plan on using my blog as a home for my portfolio, thoughts, and even videos at some point. 

To build project and create local server
`jekyll build`
`jekyll serve`
And prefix with `bundle exec` in order to ensure correct jekyll version is used.

Server name is by default http://localhost:4000/

## Project Structure
* _layouts: This folder is used for layouts, which are used to not worry about repeating html code.
* _site: This folder is generated by jekyll build. Not meant to be changed manually.
* _assets: This folder has css and images files. _assets/css has a scss file that only imports _sass/main.scss for now. 
* _data: So far just used for navigation.yml, which creates the top menu
* _posts: For blog posts. Blog post titles should start with date in `2020-08-20`-like format
* _includes: Code that uses navigation.ytml in _data by iteration
* _sass: Has main.scss files which generate css files through jekyll build. These css files are put into _site/assets.
